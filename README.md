GitHub-flavored Markdown does **not support LaTeX equations** rendered inside `\[ ... \]` or `\( ... \)` environments, nor does it support LaTeX-style alignment or matrix notation out of the box.

To render math properly on your GitHub README, you have two main options:

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 1: Use images for equations**
Best for perfect display, but less flexible/editable.

---

### ‚úÖ **Option 2: Use MathJax via HTML** *(recommended workaround)*

You can make GitHub render LaTeX using a simple MathJax setup with inline HTML tags (`<script>` and `<style>` won‚Äôt work on GitHub Pages/README, so this is limited). Instead, you can do the following:

- Use backticks with `math` environments in a simplified way using **dollar signs (`$...$` for inline, `$$...$$` for block)**.
- Equations will still **not render as math** on the main GitHub repo page but **will render** on GitHub Pages if you set up a proper Jekyll site.

But assuming you're staying in `README.md`, your best bet is to:

## ‚úÖ **Fix your current README with inline formatting**
Here's your **fixed version** that works best **on GitHub** using **`$` for inline math** and triple backticks for code.

I'll keep your formatting, but change the math parts to be Markdown/GitHub-friendly:

# principal_portfolios

A Python package implementing the **Principal Portfolios** methodology introduced by Kelly, Malamud, and Pedersen (2023), *The Journal of Finance*.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install principal_portfolios
```

---

## Overview

This package provides tools for constructing and analyzing **Principal Portfolios (PPs)**‚Äîlinear trading strategies obtained from the singular-value decomposition (SVD) of a **prediction matrix** that captures both own-asset and cross-asset predictive signals.

**Key features**

- Build the prediction matrix from return and signal panels  
- Decompose that matrix into  
  - **Principal Portfolios (PPs)** ‚Äì timeable portfolios ordered by predictability  
  - **Principal Exposure Portfolios (PEPs)** ‚Äì factor-exposed (beta) strategies  
  - **Principal Alpha Portfolios (PAPs)** ‚Äì beta-neutral (alpha) strategies

## Methodology at a glance üìê

### 1 ¬∑ Prediction matrix  

For excess-return vector $R_{t+1} \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$ and signal vector $S_t \in \mathbb{R}^{N}$:

$$
\Pi = \mathbb{E}[R_{t+1} S_t^\top]
$$

So $\Pi_{ij} = \mathbb{E}[R_{i,t+1} S_{j,t}]$ tells how signal $j$ forecasts return $i$.

---

### 2 ¬∑ Optimal linear rule  

Choose a fixed position matrix $L$ (with $\| L \| \leq 1$) to maximise:

$$
\mathbb{E}[S_t^\top L R_{t+1}]
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
L^* = (\Pi^\top \Pi)^{-1/2} \Pi^\top
$$

The optimal value equals the sum of the singular values $\{\sigma_k\}$ of $\Pi$.

---

### 3 ¬∑ Principal Portfolios (PPs)  

SVD decomposition: $\Pi = U \Sigma V^\top$.  
For each singular triplet $(u_k, v_k, \sigma_k)$:

$$
L_k = v_k u_k^\top, \quad
\text{PP}_k(t+1) = S_t^\top L_k R_{t+1}
$$

with expected return $\mathbb{E}[\text{PP}_k] = \sigma_k$.  
Summing all PPs reproduces the optimal strategy.

---

### 4 ¬∑ Alpha/Beta symmetry  

Split the prediction matrix:

$$
\Pi_s = \tfrac{1}{2}(\Pi + \Pi^\top), \quad
\Pi_a = \tfrac{1}{2}(\Pi - \Pi^\top)
$$

- **PEPs**: eigenvectors of $\Pi_s$; returns = eigenvalues; carry factor exposure.  
- **PAPs**: eigenvectors of $\Pi_a$; beta-neutral by construction; positive returns signal mispricing.

---

### 5 ¬∑ Asset-pricing test  

If signals are true betas to the pricing kernel, no-arbitrage implies:  
$\Pi$ must be symmetric & positive semi-definite.  

Therefore:  
- Negative eigenvalues in $\Pi_s$  
- Non-zero $\Pi_a$  
‚áí provide direct evidence of alpha.

You can copy and paste the fixed version above into your `README.md`. It will render properly on GitHub (though the math won't look like LaTeX‚Äîit'll be readable and clean).
